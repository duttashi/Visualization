# Pretty visuals
#### Learning to paint beautiful *data fuleled* pictures

 *"A picture is worth a thousand words"*, as the adage goes. The motivation for this repository is derived from this adage. I want to create aesthetically pleasing visuals, that conform to the visualisation principles set by experts like, *Edward Tufte*. Besides, Nathan Yau's website, *[FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/)* has been an inspiration to design custom theme for plotting data points. 

I have provided relevant references in the *resources* folder. In this folder, interested reader will find books, website links and tutorials, that have aided my understanding of visualization principles.

I benefit much from the online community in terms of learning and discussions, therefore, I will share my learning on my [blog](https://duttashi.github.io/blog/)
